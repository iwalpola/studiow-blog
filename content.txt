[OpenCV](http://https://github.com/opencv/opencv) is a large and well developed, cross platform machine vision library. Today we will take a look at how to cross compile OpenCV for 32 bit the ever growing ARM platform.

The board tested was a NanoPi M1, which is based on the Allwinner H3 SoC, and this method should work for any armbian installation on an armhf SoC. (If you are not using a hard-float installation, you must install different cross compiling toolchain - see the "Toolchain" section below.)

Prerequisites:
* Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 on x64_86 host (or [virtualbox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) of it on Windows)
* An instance of Armbian running
* SSH access to the instance
